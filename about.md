Hey there!  

My name is **Sreehari**   



I currently work as an SRE @ [GoJek](https://gojek.com)'s Engineering Platform Team (Kernel), where I primarily focus on the infrastructure side of things such as Containerisation, Scalability, Reliability, Monitoring, Change management, Capacity planning & Automation.

What interests me more in the SRE space is, I get to work on different facets of the problem, both development and operations by applying software engineering principles and practices.  




*I work with the following software, languages & tools*

*   Software languages: *Ruby, Golang, Java*  
*   Cloud providers: *GCP, AWS*   
*   Infrastructure tooling: *Terraform, Ansible*    
*   Container tooling: *Kubernetes, Docker*    
*   Traffic management: *Istio, Gloo, Consul, Envoy*
